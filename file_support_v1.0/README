Implementation of file system for nodes in ONE. (v1.0)
======================================================

The file system presence in a simulated node is optional. 
New parameters added which allow to specify more options related to
file management for a single simulation and increase simulations flexibility:

Scenario.simulateFiles 
is a boolean parameter that indicates whether or not to simulate 
the files management in mobile nodes. It applies to the whole simulation.

Group.fileCapability 
is a boolean parameter that indicates if nodes belonging to a group 
can use a file system to store files


FILE GENERATOR
==============
To create and distribute copies of a file in the simulation use the file generator.
Related parameters:

FilesGenerator.filepath
the path to the input file describing the file being generated

FilesGenerator.rngSeed 
the random number generator seed used by the file generator to randomly distrute
the file to the nodes in the simulation.
If a simulation is repeated several times with the same random seed,
files are distributed among the same subset of nodes, at the beginning of the simulation


FILE GENERATOR INPUT EXAMPLES
=============================
Files are distributed only among nodes which have a file system, that is
nodes in groups with fileCapability parameter set to true. Files distribution
can be choosen between the following:
- A (all): file is distributed among all nodes of the simulation with equal probability
- G (groups): file is only distributed among nodes belonging to specified groups
- P (percent): file is distributed among all nodes of the simulation with probability set in the request
- H (hosts): file is only distributed among specified nodes

The following are some example of input files used to create and distribute DTNFiles, 
using the DTNFileGenerator:

A	mySong.mp3	3.5M	50
Indicates to create a DTNFile with size 3,5 MB named "mySong.mp3". The
file is copied 50 times and distributed with equal probability among all users
with fileCapability = true.

P	aPhoto.jpg	5M	25
Indicates to create a DTNFile with size 5.0 MB named "aPhoto.jpg". The
file is distributed to 25% of nodes fileCapability = true.

G	aPhoto.jpg	2.4M	25	6	8	10
Indicates to create a DTNFile with size 2,4 MB named "aPhoto.jpg". The
file is copied 25 times and distributed with equal probability among all users
belonging to groups 6, 8 and 10

H	ebook.pdf	650k	42	43	44
Indicates to create a DTNFile with size 650 kB named "ebook.pdf". The ?le
is distributed among nodes with address 42, 43 e 44, one copy for every node
